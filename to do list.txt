to do with ghost hunter:

create truly random ghost spawn event. CHECK
health bar. ....maybe not?
exp bar. ...maybe not? probs just in stat screen (bottom left will be stats.)
intelligent fight?:

right now its completely useless/bugged, but its in progress. hard part is input

once intelligent fight:
create party
(classes; skills, stats)

party follows on screen like pikachu's ass in yellow
(follow will need dist code)

use speed stat to time who fights when

create combat log
